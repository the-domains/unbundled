MicroContent(tm)

**LESS IS MORE.**

Flows Everywhere

****  
**MicroContent(tm) is  streaming content without the normal delivery and processing friction.  It alleviates the burden of complex systems from having to update content separately in multiple locations.    Content is stored centrally in a platform and media-format agnostic state.  The Industry standard MongoDb backend insures rapid indexing & retrieval with multiple levels of redundancy.  All this at no trade-off to performance metrics.  
Suitable for integration into ****specialized industry vertical systems including virtually all Learning Management Systems, and Learning Record Stores (LRS).  Out of the box compatibility with any HTML page.  
MicroContent(tm) is also ideal as an intermediary format prior to applying cognitive intelligence to unstructured data.  It gives humans a hierarchical context during prepration, while providing AI algorithms a well defined & intelligently tagged unstructured data target during processing and retrieval.**  
**MicroContent(tm) utilizes industry standard xAPI statements with custom profiles that you can adjust on the fly, creating a trackable path that gauges user interest**  
**and adapts itself over time.  **
